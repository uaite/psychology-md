Releases a variety of hormones that serve numerous functions, like regulating physical growth, controlling blood pressure, or determining how much water stays in the kidneys.

Controls the other glands in the body, controlled by the [[Limbic system#Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]]. It was once called the "master gland", but now it's known that it depends heavily on the actions of other glands.

## Oxytocin

Released by the pituitary gland.

Responsible for several reproductive functions, including the stretch of the cervix during birth, and aiding milk flow in nursing mothers. It also plays essential roles in maternal and romantic love (Esch & Stefano, 2005). Coloquially known as the "love hormone" or "cuddle hormone".

Scientists have identified two closely related species of voles (a type of rodent) that differ in their pair bonding: The males of one species are promiscuous, flitting from one attractive partner to another, whereas the males of the other remain faithfully devoted to one partner for life. Only in the brains of the loyal voles are oxytocin receptors linked to the dopamine system, which as we’ve learned influences the expectation of reward (Young & Wang, 2004). 

Evidence suggests oxytocin also influences how much we trust others. In one study, men exposed to a nasal spray containing oxytocin were more likely than men exposed to a placebo spray to hand over money to their team partners in a risky investment game (Kosfeld et al., 2005; Rilling, King-Cassas, & Sanfey, 2008). 

At the same time, though, the effects of oxytocin on trust and attachment aren’t simple (Walum, Waldman, & Young, 2016), suggesting that the phrases “love molecule” and “cuddle hormone” are grossly oversimplified (Lilienfeld et al., 2015). For example, while oxytocin improves trust within favored groups, it also makes people treat outsiders worse. Among aggressive people, oxytocin seems to increase the risk of intimate violence toward partners. 

The best guess is oxytocin boosts sensitivity to social cues, both for good and for bad.
