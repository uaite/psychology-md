The part of the nervous system formed by the nerves extending out of the [[Central nervous system (CNS)]].

Consists of two branches, somatic and autonomic.

## Somatic nervous system

Carries messages from the CNS to muscles throughout thee body, controlling movement. They cooperate to stabilize and move our joins, and regulate our posture and bodily movement.

Making a decision to get something from a vending machine:
	1. Sensory inputs of all kinds reach the cortex
	2. All parts of the cortex send information to the basal ganglia
	3. The basal ganglia process the information, make a decision, and pass it forward to the motor cortex
	4. The motor cortex sends commands to the spinal cord, activating motor neurons
	5. These neurons send messages through nerves, reaching muscles throughout the body and triggering muscle contractions
	6. We walk, reach, touch, and grasp

The brain triggers this whole sequence, but the somatic nervous system carries it out.

## Autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system also interacts with the brain, especially the limbic system, to control emotion and internal physical states. It's part of the nervous system that controls the involuntary actions of organs and glands. Together with the limbic system, it regulates  emotions.

It is divided into two parts, the sympathetic and parasympathetic. They work in opposing directions, so when one is active, the other is passive.

### Sympathetic nervous system

Active during emotional arousal, especially during crises. Its neurons tend to fire together ("in sympathy"). This system mobilizes the [[Fight-or-flight|fight-or-flight]] response.

Sympathetic activation triggers several physical responses that help reacting during a crisis, like increased heart rate (more blood flow), respiration, and perspiration.

### Parasympathetic nervous system

Contrasting to the sympathetic nervous system, it is active during rest and digestion. It works when there's no threat on the radar.
