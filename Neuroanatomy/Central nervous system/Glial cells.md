*Note: glial means glue*

Perform a variety of functions in the brain. They're a protective scaffolding for the neurons, but they also clear away debris, acting as a garbage collector. They may also play key roles in neural transmission

Treatments targeting glial cells may assist in depression, schizophrenia (Cotter, Pariant, & Everall, 2001; Schroeter et al., 2009), as well as inflammation, chronic pain and Alzheimer (Suter et al., 2007)

It was once thought the ratio between glial cells and neurons were 10:1, but recent research shows it's closer to 1:1.

## Astrocytes
Glial cells shaped like stars. Interacts with 300,000 to 1,000,000 neurons.

- Increases the accuracy of a neuron's transmission, helps control blood flow in the brain, vital to the development of the embryo (Metea & Newman, 2006)
- Intimately involved in thought, memory, and the immune system (Gibbs & Bowser, 2009; Koob, 2009)
- Abundant in the [[Blood-brain barrier]]

## Oligodendrocyte
- Promotes new connections among neurons
- Releases chemicals to aid in healing
- Produces an insulating wrapper around axons, the [[Neuron#Myelin sheath|myelin sheath]]
