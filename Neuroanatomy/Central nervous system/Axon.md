Long tail-like extensions for sending messages to other neurons. Usually very thin near the cell body, creating an area that's easily activated by incoming signals. The end of the axon is referred to as **axon terminal**.

## Synaptic vesicle

Tiny spheres that travel through the axon to the axon terminal. When a synaptic vesicle reaches the end of the axon terminal, it bursts, releasing [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]]. 

## Myelin sheath

Protective insulation around axons. 

Contains gaps along the axon called **Nodes of Ranvier**, which help the neuron to conduct electricity more efficiently as the neural signal jumps from node to node and are necessary for the [[Action potential|action potential]] to occur.

Its importance is visible in multiple sclerosis, a condition where the myelin sheath is progressively degraded. Without the insulation of the messages, they are scrambled, resulting in several physical and emotional symptoms, included difficulties in coordination.
