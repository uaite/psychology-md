### Brain organization
- [[Cerebral cortex|Cortex]]
	- Frontal lobe
		  performs executive functions that coordinate other brain areas, motor planning, language, and memory
	- Parietal lobe
		  processes touch information; integrates vision and touch
	- Temporal lobe
		  processes auditory information, language, and autobiographical memory
	- Occipital lobe
		  processes visual information
- [[Basal ganglia]]
	  control movement and motor planning
- [[Limbic system]]
	- Thalamus
		  conveys sensory information to the cortex
	- Hypothalamus
		  oversees endocrine and autonomic nervous systems
	- Amygdala
		  regulates arousal and fear
	- Hippocampus
		  processes memory for spatial locations
- [[Cerebellum]]
	  controls balance and coordinated movement
- [[Brain stem]]
	- Midbrain
		  tracks visual stimuli and reflexes triggered by sound
	- Pons
		  conveys information between the cortex and cerebellum
	- Medula
		  regulates breathing and heartbeats
- [[Spinal cord]]
	  conveys information between the brain and the rest of the body
