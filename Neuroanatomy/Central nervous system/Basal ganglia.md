Structures buried deep inside the cortex that help control movement. After sensory information reaches primary and association areas, it's transmitted to the basal ganglia, which calculate a course of action and transmit it to the motor cortex. 

They also allow performing movements to obtain rewards (Graybiel et al., 1994; Seger & Spiering, 2011). When anticipating a pleasurable outcome, we depend in part on activity in the basal ganglia.

Damage to basal ganglia contributes to Parkinson's disease, characterized by a lack of control over movement and uncontrollable tremors. Tourette's disorder, which causes motor and vocal tics, also appears to be associated with abnormalities in the basal ganglia (Mallet et al., 2015; Peterson et al., 2003).
