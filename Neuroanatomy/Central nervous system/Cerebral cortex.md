 Analyzes sensory information, helping perform complex functions like reasoning and language. The largest component of the [[Cerebrum or Forebrain|forebrain/cerebrum]].

Cortex means "bask", referencing how the cortex wraps the hemispheres like bark on a tree.

The cortex contains four regions called lobes, each associated with somewhat different functions. Both hemispheres contain the same four lobes.

## Frontal lobe

Responsible for self-awareness, judgement, planning, and decision making. Oversees other cognitive functions (*executive functioning*) that coordinate other brain areas, motor planning, language, and memory. 

In most people's brains, a deep groove called the *central sulcus* separates the frontal lobe from the rest of the cortex. Next to this groove, lies the **motor cortex**. 
### Motor cortex 
Each part of it controls a specific part of the body. Some regions require more precise motor control, like fingers, so they consume more cortical space.

In front of the motor cortex, lies the **prefrontal cortex**.
### Prefrontal cortex
A big part of the frontal lobe. Responsible for thinking, planning, and language. There's a specific part called **Broca's area** (named after surgeon Paul Broca) which is vital for the formation of speech. Broca found that many patients with damage in this area had trouble speaking.

The prefrontal cortex receives information from many other regions of the cerebral cortex, so it also contributes to mood, personality, and self-awareness. Damage to this region boosts risk for impulsive behavior, demonstrated by the famous case of [[Phineas Gage]].
## Parietal lobe

The upper middle part of the cerebral cortex, lying behind the frontal lobe. Specialized with touch and sensation (*somatosensory cortex*). It helps with several tasks: 
- Processes touch information, integrates vision and touch;
- Helps track objects' locations , shapes, and orientations;
- Assists with processing other people's actions and representing numbers symbolically and expressing them verbally;
- Relays visual and touch information to the motor cortex when we reach, grasp, and move our eyes
The back region of the parietal lobe, behind the motor cortex, is the **primary sensory cortex**, which is sensitive to touch, including pressure, pain, and temperature. 

Because of the parietal lobe's role in spatial perception, damage to it causes difficulty processing one's immediate surroundings, even their own bodies. A frequent consequence is neglecting the opposite side of the body from where the damage occurred. See [[Mrs. S]].

## Temporal lobe

Processes auditory information,  language, and autobiographical memory. Prime site of hearing, understanding language, and storing memories of the past. 

Separated from the rest of the cortex by a horizontal groove called the **lateral fissure**.

The top of the temporal lobe contains the **auditory cortex**, which is dedicated to hearing and located right next to the motor area of the cortex.

The lower part of the temporal lobe is critical to storing memories of autobiographical events. Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield discovered that stimulus to this region elicits memories, like vivid recollections of a song or the view from a childhood window. However, these memories could also be false or altered perceptions rather than genuine memories of the past.

### Wernicke's area
Language area in the temporal lobe. Also includes the lower parietal lobe. Located slightly above and behind the left ear - unless you're left-handed, which means it might be above the right ear. 

Damage to this area results in severe difficulties understanding speech and tendency to speak mostly in gibberish.

## Occipital lobe

Processes visual information with the **visual cortex**. Located at the back of the brain. Humans are especially reliant on visual systems, so this one is large.

## Cortical hierarchies

When sensory information, such as sight, hearing, or touch, is transmitted, it reaches the **primary sensory cortex** specific to that sense. After the eye, ear, or skin relays the information to the primary sensory cortex, it's passed to the **association cortex**, which is spread throughout all four lobes. Most of the cerebrum consists of the association cortex, about 3/4 of it. This suggests that what makes us smart is integrating information across different brain areas.
The association cortex synthesizes sensory information to perform more complex functions, like combining size, shape, color, and location information to identify an object. 

The overall organization of the cortex is hierarchical because processing becomes increasingly complex as information is passed up the network. As such, people with damage to the association cortex can have difficulties recognizing faces or answering questions about people just by looking at their faces.
