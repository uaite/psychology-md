Performs some of the basic bodily functions for staying alive. Contains the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla.

The midbrain plays an important role in movement, and controls the tracking of visual stimuli and reflexes triggered by sound - like jumping after a startling sound.

Housed inside the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and located at the very back of the brain.

## Reticular activating system (RAS)

Plays a key role in arousal. Connects with the [[Cerebrum or Forebrain|forebrain]] and the [[Cerebral cortex|cerebral cortex]]. Also known as reticular formation. 

Pathways from the RAS activate the cortex by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio among neurons in the brain (Gu, 2002). When there's a lot of background noise, communication is difficult - so medication for ADHD appears to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the prefrontal cortex. One hypothesis is that these stimulants mimics activity in the RAS and neighboring brain regions, but other explanations are possible. For example, methylphenidate boosts levels of dopamine, which can help explain why it improves attention and impulse control (Volkow et al., 2005).
 
Damage to the RAS can result in a coma. Some scientists believe many KOs in boxing come from a temporary compression of the RAS (Weisberg, Garcia, & Strub, 1996).

## Pons

The pons plays a crucial role in triggering dreams and connects the cortex to the cerebellum.

Lies in the hindbrain.
## Medulla

The medulla regulates breathing, heartbeat, and other vital functions. It also controls nausea and vomiting, which can explain why sometimes people want to throw up after a hard hit to the back of the head. It's where nerves cross from one side of the body to the opposite side.

Damage to the medulla can cause brain death, an irreversible coma. Brain dead people are completely unaware of their surroundings and unresponsive, even to very painful stimuli. They show no sings of spontaneous movement, respiration, or reflex activity. 

See [[Terri Schiavo]] for details on brain death vs persistent vegetative state.
