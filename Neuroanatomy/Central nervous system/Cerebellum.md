Latin for *little brain*. In many ways, a miniature version of the cortex. Plays a predominant role in the sense of balance, and enables coordinating movement and learning motor skills. Among other things, it prevents us from falling down. It's part of the hindbrain.

Damage to the cerebellum frequently causes serious balance issues. 

More recent research shows the cerebellum also contributes to executive, memory, spatial, and linguistic abilities (Schmahmann, 2004; Swain, Kerr, & Thompson, 2011).
