A tiny-fluid filled space between neurons through which neurotransmitters travel. This gap is surrounded by small patches of a membrane on each side, connecting one neuron's axon terminal and the dendrite of another.

Neurotransmitters are released into the cleft from the axon terminal and picked up by dendrites.
