A 30-year old woman who had her left and right [[Limbic system#Amygdala|amygdalas]] almost entirely destroyed by a rare disease. She had no difficulty identifying faces, but was markedly impaired in detecting fear in these faces. She also displayed no fear in commonly scary situations.

A nice case study, but requires more replicability.
