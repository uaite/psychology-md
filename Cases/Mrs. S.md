Experienced a serious stroke in her right [[Cerebral cortex#Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]]. She routinely only put make-up on the right side of her face and completely ignored the left side, which would be governed by the right parietal lobe. She often went hungry because she only noticed food on the left side of plates, even though the entire plate would be within her field of vision. This was solved by shifting her wheelchair slightly to the right after eating, which enabled her to attend to the rest of the food.
