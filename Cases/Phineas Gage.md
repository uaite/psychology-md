A railroad foreman who was involved in an accident where an explosion propelled an iron bar through his head, destroying much of his [[Cerebral cortex#Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]]. Later computer analyses suggest that the rod passed largely or entirely through the left frontal lobes. 

After the accident, his personality was described as fitful, irreverent, profane, which was not how he would be described previously. People said he was no longer himself. However, there's evidence suggesting his personality changes may not have been as drastic or long-lasting as assumed, reminding us of the brains' [[Plasticity|plasticity]].
