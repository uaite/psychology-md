The nervous' system ability to change over time, such as in response to damage.

Typically, the brain is most plastic during early development, since the brain doesn't fully mature until late adolescente or early adulthood. Some parts mature faster than others.

The network of neurons changes during development in four primary ways:
1. growth of dendrites and axons; 
2. synaptogenesis, the formation of new synapses; 
3. pruning, consisting of the death of certain neurons and the retraction of axons to remove connections that arenâ€™t useful; and 
4. myelination, the insulation of axons with a myelin sheath. 

During pruning, as much as 70% of neurons die. This is helpful because it streamlines neural organization, enhancing communication.

## Learning

When we learn, our brains change. These changes can result from the formation of new synapses, generating increased connections and communication among neurons. They can also result from the strengthening of existing connections, so neurotransmitters released into them produce a stronger and more prolonged response from nearby neurons - this is known as potentiation.



## Following injury and degeneration

Certain brain regions can take over functions previously performed by others if they are damaged. For example, in blind people, reading braille is done by brain regions associated with vision in sighted people (Hamilton & Pascual-Leone, 1998; Sathian, 2005). 

Neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS are connected to brain or spinal cord damage.

## Neurogenesis

The creation of new neurons in the adult brain. 

Neurogenesis in certain areas of the brain in adult monkeys has been observed (Gage, 2002; Gould & Gross, 2002) , but this is still controversial when it comes to adult humans (Dennis et al., 2016).

## Stem cells

Cells which haven't yet committed to a specific function, so they can potentially become many kinds of specialized cells.

Stem cells can be used for treating diseases marked by neural degeneration by implanting them into the host's nervous system and inducing them to grow and replace damaged cells. These cells can also be genetically engineered to be used in gene therapy.
