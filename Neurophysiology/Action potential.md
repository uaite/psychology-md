How neurons communicate. Abrupt waves of electrical discharge triggered by a massive change in charge inside the [[Axon|axon]]. This is what is commonly known as a neuron firing.

Action potentials originate in the trigger zone near the cell body and continue through the whole axon to the terminal. During an action potential, positively charged particles flow rapidly into the axon, then flow out just as rapidly, causing a sudden spike in positive charged follow by a sudden decrease in charge, with the inside charge ending slightly more negative than the resting value (see figure).

These shifts in charge release electricity. When the electrical charge reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the [[Synaptic cleft|synaptic cleft]].

Action potential are "all or nothing". That is, it either occurs at full strength, or doesn't occur at all.

## Absolute refractory period

Brief interval following an action potential during which another one cannot occur. Limits the fastest rate at which a neuron can fire. Bear in mind neurons can fire up to 1000 times per second.

Colloquially, the "reload" period.
