The main purpose of [[Neuron|neurons]] is communication, and the name of this process is **neurotransmission**. It's an **electrochemical process**, where the electrical part is communication within neurons, and the chemical is between neurons.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Neurotransmission is a constant back and forth between the electrical process within a neuron and the chemical process between neurons.</mark>
## Communication between neurons

The chemical process describes how the [[Axon|axon]] of one neuron sends information to the [[Neuron#Dendrites|dendrites]] of other neurons.

Axon terminals release [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]] across the [[Synaptic cleft|synaptic cleft]]. The dendrites receive the neurotransmitters. Each receptor is specialized in one type of neurotransmitter, so the contact needs to reach the right receiver. Think of a lock and key analogy.

## Communication within neurons

This is the neuron's electrical activity. The basis of all electrical responses in neurons depends on an uneven distribution of charged particles across the membrane surrounding the neuron (potential difference).

Neurons have an electrical charge, which is -70mV at rest (*resting potential*). Once neurotransmitters bind to the receptors of a dendrite, the electrical charge shifts. If the excitatory neurotransmitters manage to increase the charge inside the neuron to a certain **threshold**, the [[Action potential|action potential]] is triggered. 

## Reuptake

Continually occurring process in which the [[Axon#Synaptic vesicle|synaptic vesicle]] reabsorbs the [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]], halting the neurotransmission. Release and reuptake can be thought of as analogous to letting liquid drop out of a straw, then sucking it back up. It's a recycling mechanism.
