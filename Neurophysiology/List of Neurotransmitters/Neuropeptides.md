Short strings of amino acids in the nervous system. They're similar to neurotransmitters, but more specialized. 

**Endorphins** are a type of neuropeptide that play specialized roles in pain reduction (Holden, Jeong, & Forrest, 2005; Usdin, Bunney, & Kline, 2016). They were discovered in scientists were trying to pinpoint the physiological mechanisms of opioids in the 1970s.

They can be thought of as endogenous (naturally occurring) opioids. Human-made opioids work by hijacking the endorphin system, binding to their receptors and mimicking their effects.

There are also other neuropeptides tied to hunger and satiety, leaning, and memory.
