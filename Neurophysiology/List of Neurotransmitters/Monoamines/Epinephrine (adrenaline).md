Boosts energy production in muscle cells while conserving as much energy as possible. Release is triggered by nerves of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Adrenaline triggers many actions, including:
- contraction of the heart muscle and blood vessel constriction for improved blood flow
- opening the bronchioles of the lungs to allow more air inhalation
- breakdown of fat into fatty acids, providing more fuel to run 
- breakdown of glycogen (carb) into glucose (sugar) to energize the muscles
- opening pupils to enable better sight during emergencies

It also inhibits gastrointestinal secretions, which explains dry mouth or losing appetite when one feels nervous.

Adrenaline can also be massively released during pleasurable and exciting activities, like skydiving.
