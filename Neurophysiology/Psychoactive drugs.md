Drugs that interact with neurotransmitter systems, affecting mood, thinking, arousal, or observable behavior.

Some drugs work as [[Antagonists|antagonists]]. For example, medication for treating schizophrenia work by blocking dopamine receptors (Bennett, 1998; Compton & Broussard, 2009). Another example is botox, which binds to acetylcholine (Mukherjee, 2015).

## Opiates
Examples: codeine, morphine, alprazolam

Function as [[Agonists|agonists]]. Reduce our emotional response to painful stimuli by binding with opioid receptors and mimicking endorphins (Evans, 2004).

Tranquilizers like xanax (alprazolam) reduce anxiety by stimulating GABA receptors, driving down neuronal activity (Roy-Byrne, 2005).

## Antidepressants
Examples:  fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, fluvoxamine

Many work by inhibiting [[Reuptake||reuptake]] of neurotransmitters, especially serotonin (SSRIs). By allowing the neurotransmitters to remain in the [[Synaptic cleft|synapse]] for longer than usual, their effects are enhanced.
