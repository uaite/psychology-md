There are multiple types of research that can be used to test a question.

**Experimental designs** are the most used, since they are the only one that can draw cause-and-effect conclusions. However, other designs, such as **correlational studies**, **case studies**, and **naturalistic observations** are still useful and can provide other kinds of information. 


## Experimental designs

As an example, consider a study testing whether interaction with a dog reduces stress levels.

The goal of an experimental study is to determine if making changes to the independent variable will cause changes in the dependent variable. (See [[#Variables]])

These changes are referred to as cause-and-effect or causation. The independent variable *causes* change in the dependent variable. To achieve this design, a researcher must follow these steps:
1. Manipulate at least one independent variable;
2. Measure whether changes occur in the dependent variable as a result of manipulating the independent variable;
3. Must try to control other factors that might influence the results. Ideally, the only variables that change should be the experiment is interested in. Everything else should stay consistent, otherwise causation may not be implied. In the example, if the room doing no-dog testing is very noisy and the room with a dog is peaceful, the amount of noise would be a **confounding variable**.
### Variables
Any characteristic that can vary and might be of interest in the study. 

**Independent variables** are the one that are manipulated by the researcher. Usually described as having **levels**.  In the example, the independent variable is the dog interaction. The levels would depend on what is being tested. One level would be zero interaction, the next could be 15 minutes, and another could be 30 minutes.

**Dependent variables** are the outcome variable being measured. The goal of an experiment is to see how differences in the independent variable affect the dependent variable. Consequently, the dependent variable *depends* on the independent variable. In the example, the stress level is the dependent variable.

**Confounding variables** are variables that distort the cause-and-effect conclusions.

### Operational definition
Defines a variable in terms of specific procedures used to measure it. For example, interacting with a dog is a variable, and consequently needs an operational definition. One researcher could define it as petting the dog, other might define it as playing fetch, and so on. Researchers have to be specific about how they are defining it for the purposes of the study.

### Types of experimental designs
There are two main types of experimental studies: **between-subject** and **within-subject**. Both draw cause-and-effect conclusions. The difference is regarding the participants.

#### Between-subject design
Uses different participants for each condition (or level of the independent variable). In the dog example, not interacting with the dogs and interacting for 15 minutes would be two conditions. In this scenario, half the participants would be randomly assigned to no interaction, and the other half to dog interaction. **Random assignment** is a key element.

Afterwards, the two groups would be compared to see which one experienced a greater reduction in stress levels.

#### Within-subject design
Uses the same participant for each condition. In the dog example, all participants would do both no interaction and dog interaction. Given that cortisol levels would be measured in this study, the participants would need to participate on two different days to attend both conditions. The advantage here being there are no individual differences between participants, and the disadvantage that there's a possibility of practice effects.

## Correlational designs

Used when a researcher is trying to find how much two variables are related. It's **not looking** for cause-and-effect. 

In this type of design, there are no independent or dependent variables. There are just variables of interest being measured. Once enough data is collected, the statistic significance of the relation can be found.

An example correlational study could try to determine that the friendlier you are to your coworkers, the more they like you. Consequently, there is a relationship between the amount of your friendliness and the amount the people like you. However, you can't assume that being friendlier causes people to like you more, since it may be the reverse: being liked causes you to be friendlier. A correlational study can only see if a relationship **exists**. For cause-and-effect, you need an experimental study.

### Correlation coefficient
Ranges between -1 to +1, where the sign represents the direction of the relationship, and the number, the strength. 

A **positive correlation** means the two variables change in the same direction: as X increases, Y also increases. This does not imply that changes in X cause changes in Y. A classic example is height and weight - someone taller is expected to weight more.

A **negative correlation** means the variables change in opposite directions: as X increases, Y decreases, and vice-versa. Again, this doesn't imply causation. A student that skips class will have lower grades, but both issues (skipping class and lower grades) could originate from high levels of stress.

The **absolute value** of a correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the correlation. Higher values represent stronger correlations, from 0 to 1.

### Advantages
- can be a useful first step in a series of research studies, since finding a correlation can lead to a prediction about why it exists, prompting an experimental study
- great for determining real-world associations since there is no variable manipulation
- useful alternative when experiments are unethical (ex. the impacts of alcohol on the fetus during pregnancy)

### Disadvantages
- unable do draw cause-and-effect conclusions (causation)
- unable to identify any other variable that might be causing the relationship

## Behavioral genetics designs

Used to estimate the [[Heritability|heritability]] of a trait. Useful for determining how much genes and environment contribute to each trait.

### Family studies
Examines the extent to which a characteristic "runs" in intact families (where all members are raised in the same home). A crucial drawback is that biological relatives share a similar environment, so researchers can't really separate the effects of nature from nurture. As such, investigators have turned to more informative designs that separate these influences better.

### Twin studies
Examine trait differences between identical and fraternal twins. The logic here is that identical twins share more biological material than fraternal twins (100 vs 50), so if a psychological characteristic is more present in identical twins than in fraternal twins, we can infer it is genetically influenced, assuming the environmental influences are the same.

### Adoption studies
To address the shortcomings of family studies, psychologists have turned to this kind of design. It examines the extent to which children adopted into new homes resemble their adoptive versus their biological parents. If a child resembles their biological parents on a psychological characteristic, we can typically assume it's genetically influenced, since the child doesn't share the same environment as their biological family.

An important potential confound is **selective placement**. Adoption agencies frequently place children in homes similar to those of their biological parents. This can lead researchers to mistakenly interpret the similarity between the child and the biological family as genetic in origin.
