Used when trying to infer conclusions about a larger population from the data collected from a sample. To determine if the findings are meaningful, the researcher needs to run analyses and obtain statistic significance. 

The most basic analysis is a t-test, which is used to compare the mean of two groups. 

Statistic significante is determined by calculating a p-value, which is generally $p < 0.05$. This states that the probability of the result occurring by chance is less than 5%.

$p > 0.05$ is generally statistically insignificant.
