The extent to which genes contribute to differences in a trait **among individuals**. Typically expressed as a percentage.

If the heritability of a trait is 60%, that means that more than half of the differences **among individuals** in their levels of that trait are due to differences in their genes. By definition, the other 40% is due to differences in their environments.

Some traits are highly heritable, like height, which is 70% to 80% in adults. Other traits are almost entirely environmental, such as religious affiliation. The depth of religious belief, however, is moderately heritable, perhaps because it's partly due to personality traits, which are themselves partly heritable.

## Misconceptions

Heritability **does not apply to a single individual**. It tells us of the causes of differences among people.

Heritability says little or nothing about how malleable a trait is. If a trait is highly heritable, it doesn't mean it can't be changed. Behavioral geneticists refer to *reaction range* as the extent to which genes set limits on how much a trait can change in response to new environments. 

Heritability is **not a fixed number**. It can differ dramatically across different time periods and populations. If we reduce the range of environmental influences on a trait within a population, the heritability of that trait will increase because more of the differences in that trait will be due to genetic factors, and vice-versa.
