Psychology is hard to define as it is a vast discipline, encompassing the study of perceptions, emotions, thoughts, observable behaviors, and more, from several perspectives. We can try to simplify it to the study of the mind, brain, and behavior.

Psychology is a discipline that spans multiple **levels of analysis**. Think of it as steps on a ladder, with the bottom steps tied closer to biological influences, and the higher, to social and cultural influences. To fully understand psychology, we need to consider multiple levels of analysis. Think of watching a city from a glass elevator: as you ascend, you get a broader view of how things connect and influence each other, but close to the ground, you see the details of the roads, bridges, and buildings.

## Naive realism

We trust our common sense in part due to proneness to naive realism. That's because we trust our intuitive perceptions of the world and ourselves, which serves us well for most cases in daily life.

Yet, appearances can be deceived. The sun *seems* to revolve around the earth, and the earth *seems* flat, both things that people believed due to their perceptions before science proved them otherwise. It's important to have this in mind when thinking about using our common sense and perceptions to draw conclusions.

## ABCs

Three major areas of study of psychology which influence each other.

### Affect
refers to our experiences of our feelings, emotions and moods. Can be positive (happy, excited), and negative (sad, lonely, bored); vary in intensity (mildly interested vs. extremely giddy).

### Behaviour
refers to our actions and reactions to external and internal stimuli. Can be categorized as overt (observable actions) or covert (not directly observable actions). A major focus of psychology is to understand the factors that influence or cause behaviors.

### Cognition
refers to our mental processes including thinking and decision making; how we acquire knowledge and process information. It includes all our conscious and unconscious processes.

## Psychology is a science

It's important to highlight psychology as a science. It has four main goals in research:

**Describe affects, behaviors and cognitions**
Think "what are they?"

**Explain and understand the causes and processes of the ABCs**
Think "how do they work?". How do we perceive external stimuli? How do we learn new behaviors?

**Predict behaviors (and affects and cognitions to a certain degree)**
Think "if we know X, can we predict Y?"

**Influence or control affects, behaviors or cognitions under certain conditions**
Think "if we know the relationship between X and Y, can we manipulate situations to influence or elicit Y?". For example, if we know people are more helpful when they are in a good mod, can we elicit helpful behavior by creating a positive environment?

## Perspectives

There are six main perspectives in psychology to consider. None of them are more important or more correct than the other. The fields benefits from having multiple perspectives, allowing more questions to be asked with more fulfilling, well-rounded answers.

### Biological
Focused on the biological determinants of the ABCs. It's the physical side of human nature, explaining psychology through brain structures and functions, biochemical processes, psychophysiological responses, and genetic factors.

There are two main schools of thought, representing different views on the mind-body problem. 
The first is **mind-body dualism**, which suggests the mind and the brain are separate entities. Theorists and philosophers who promoted this school of thought argued that the mind is a spiritual entity not subject to physical laws. The second is **monism**, which suggests the mind and the brain are one and the same. Some argue that the mind is simply a function of the brain, while others argue that the body and the brain are merely a perception of the mind. In either case, monism argues that the mind and the brain are intertwined.

Generally, biological psychology researchers prefer monism.

Besides the role of the brain, this perspective is also interested in the role of genetics. Evolutionary psychology falls here.

### Cognitive
Primarily focused on the cognitive component of psychology. Researchers and theorists examine mental processes to explain affect and behavior.

Two early schools of thought were **structuralism** and **functionalism**.

**Strucutralism** was established by Wilhelm Wundt and his student, Edward Titchener. Wundt is generally accepted as the person who established psychology as a branch of science. This school of thought was focused on determining the elements (structures) of the mind and of consciousness. The main method for study was introspection.

**Functionalism** was established by WIlliam James, credited with writing the first psychology textbook in 1890. Functionalism was focused on understanding how the mind works or functions. Researchers from this school of thought were primarily interested in applying psychological reserach to everyday settings.

Neither school is still in practice, but they laid the foundation for the cognitive perspective.

### Psychodynamic
Focused on the unconscious and was established by Sigmund Freud. According to him, the unconscious mind has a greater influence on our ABCs than our conscious mind. Freud and his peers, like Carl Jung and Alfred Adler, have made contributions to many areas of psychology, notably personality psychology and clinical psychology, but Freud is a controversial and outdated figure in psychology.

### Behavioral
Also known as behaviorism. Many theorists have proposed the mind is a blank slate. Experiences and the environment condition you to behave and react in specific ways. Radical behaviorists consider affect and cognition to be irrelevant because they aren't observable.

A few important names are Ivan Pavlov (Pavlov's dog), John Watson (Little Albert), and B.F. Skinner (impact of rewards and punishments).

### Humanistic
Also known as humanism. The most optimistic view of psychology. It's focused on achieving one's full potential, being the best one can be. They promote the idea that, regardless of your past, you can always turn things around. It has laid the foundation of a new area of psychology called Positive Psychology.

It was established by Abraham Maslow, who created the hierarchy of needs. Maslow proposed that human needs can be grouped into five categories: physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. The way the hierarchy works is that you need to satisfy your needs at the lowest level to be able to move up to the next level. Reaching the highest level of self-actualization is when you can achieve your best self. Throughout life, you can move up and down the hierarchy.

### Sociocultural
Focused on how social and cultural factors influence affect, behavior and cognition. Consequently, a lot of research looks for similarities and differences between cultures.

Culture can be defined and various ways, but a broad approach is to consider two main categories: **individualistic** and **collectivictic**.

**Individualistic** cultures emphasize personal goals and self-identity based on one's own achievements. This is commonly found in the west.

**Collectivistic** cultures emphasize group goals and identity is defined by ties to the family. Commonly found in Asia, Africa and South America. Canada's first nations also tend to favour a collectivistic culture.
