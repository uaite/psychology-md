Condition of the brain where a person cannot pay attention to one of the sides of their world. They are influenced by the information coming from the problematic side, but don't know that they're being affected by it.

In one experiment, participants were asked to describe a location that they knew well, like a park. If they had left hemispatial neglect (the right side of the brain is impacted), they would only describe the right side of the park. However, when asked to imagine that they were on the opposite side, the only only now describe the new side of the park, completely ignoring the side they had described earlier.

In another experiment, participants were asked to draw a analog clock, and they would smush all the numbers together on one side of the clock.
